# project1
The project is just a basic backend code for a cafe called MASTER AK CAFE.
I have used the basic functions including connectivity in mysql.
The project is a cafe app that provides the following tools: logging in for the previous users/ registration for new users and saves the info through sql connectivity, it provides the menu and enables you to place order. The costumer info like the basis details and the order history gets stored in the form of a separate database for each user.
This part of the app is made for the consumer but later on i will be adding the admin option as well like checking totals sales, orders and costumer info.
Other backend options like editing the order, deleting, payment options, etc. and some entertainment options like some mini games will also be added.
thankyou for visiting the master ak cafe app :)
